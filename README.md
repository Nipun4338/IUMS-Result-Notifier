# IUMS-Result-Notifier

So I am a kind of lazy coder! And my university gives our course results in a Integrated University Management System hosted on a website, but without giving any notification
or e-mail. And literally I had to do login multiple times a day to know whether any course result has publised or not(XD)!
After learning some basic web scraping, done a small script which enter to the site, scrap the selected portion where result always publishes, check whether any changes in it or not, 
then send it to my email if any changes were made.
